# Scrabble

Scrabble, this is a game where players attempt to create words from a set of letter tiles. Different letters have different points allocated to them.
In the English alphabet, letters have the following point scores:
Point(s)	Letter(s)
1			E, A, I, O, N, R, T, L, S, U
2			D, G
3			B, C, M, P
4			F, H, V, W, Y
5			K
8			J, X
10			Q, Z

Calculate the score for a word. The score is the sum of the points for the letters that make up a word.
For example: GUARDIAN = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10.
