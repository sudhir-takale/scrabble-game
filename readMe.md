# Scrabble

Scrabble, this is a game where players attempt to create words from a set of letter tiles. Different letters have
different points allocated to them.
In the English alphabet, letters have the following point scores:

- Point(s)    Letter(s)
- 1 &nbsp;&nbsp; E, A, I, O, N, R, T, L, S, U
- 2 &nbsp;&nbsp; D, G

- 4 &nbsp;&nbsp; F, H, V, W, Y
- 5 &nbsp;&nbsp; K
- 8 &nbsp;&nbsp; J, X
- 10 &nbsp;&nbsp; Q, Z

Calculate the score for a word. The score is the sum of the points for the letters that make up a word.

- For example: GUARDIAN = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10.
