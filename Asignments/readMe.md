# Unusual Spends

You work at a credit card company and as a value-add they want to start providing alerts to users when their spending in any particular category is higher than usual.
 - Compare the total amount paid for the current month, grouped by category with the previous month 
 - Filter down to the categories for which the user spent at least 50% more this month than last month
 - Compose an e-mail message to the user that lists the categories for which spending was    unusually high


## Sample Email
